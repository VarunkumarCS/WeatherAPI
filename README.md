# WeatherAPI

In this project, I'm getting an API data of weather for my selected town, city (longitude, latitude) from 'https://openweathermap.org/'.

Then I do the following on the above API data mentioned:

a) Pulling the API data in the JSON format.

b) Pulling all the attributes from the API data.

c) Parsing the Data

- Print the Town/ city Name.
- Printing the Temperature.
- Printing the Visibility.

I've used (Requests, JSON, PPRINT, JSON Decode Error, Time) packages in the Python script.
